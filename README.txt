REMIX DEFAULT WORKSPACE

Remix default workspace is present when:
i. Remix loads for the very first time 
ii. A new workspace is created with 'Default' template
iii. There are no files existing in the File Explorer

This workspace contains 3 directories:

1. 'contracts': Holds three contracts with increasing levels of complexity.
2. 'scripts': Contains four typescript files to deploy a contract. It is explained below.
3. 'tests': Contains one Solidity test file for 'Ballot' contract & one JS test file for 'Storage' contract.

SCRIPTS

The 'scripts' folder has four typescript files which help to deploy the 'Storage' contract using 'web3.js' and 'ethers.js' libraries.

For the deployment of any other contract, just update the contract's name from 'Storage' to the desired contract and provide constructor arguments accordingly 
in the file `deploy_with_ethers.ts` or  `deploy_with_web3.ts`

In the 'tests' folder there is a script containing Mocha-Chai unit tests for 'Storage' contract.

To run a script, right click on file name in the file explorer and click 'Run'. Remember, Solidity file must already be compiled.
Output from script will appear in remix terminal.

Please note, require/import is supported in a limited manner for Remix supported modules.
For now, modules supported by Remix are ethers, web3, swarmgw, chai, multihashes, remix and hardhat only for hardhat.ethers object/plugin.
For unsupported modules, an error like this will be thrown: '<module_name> module require is not supported by Remix IDE' will be shown.

In this project demo.sol is a contract written for buy and sell chai smart contract and demo1.sol is written for event management smart contract hope this helps you.
🚀 Exciting News: Revolutionizing Event Organization with Blockchain Smart Contracts! 🎉

I am thrilled to share the results of our latest project, which has the potential to transform the event industry as we know it. 🌐

🔗 Blockchain-Powered Event Management

💡 Key Features and Achievements:

🎫 Ticket Transfers: One of the standout features of our solution is the ability to send event tickets securely from one customer to another. This innovation reduces the complexities of ticket distribution and ensures that tickets end up in the hands of those who truly intend to attend the event.

📅 Efficient Event Planning: Our smart contracts automate various event-related processes, from ticket sales to refund policies, ensuring that event organizers can focus on creating memorable experiences for attendees rather than administrative tasks.

🔐 Enhanced Security: By harnessing the power of blockchain, we've fortified the security of event data, safeguarding sensitive information and reducing the risk of fraudulent activities.

🌟 Benefits to the Event Industry:

✨ Trust and Transparency: Smart contracts ensure trust and transparency in event transactions, reducing the likelihood of disputes and increasing customer confidence.

🌐 Global Accessibility: With blockchain technology, event tickets become accessible to a global audience, breaking down geographical barriers.

💰 Cost Efficiency: The elimination of intermediaries and manual processes results in cost savings for event organizers.

📣 Get Involved:

We're eager to collaborate with event organizers, industry experts, and stakeholders who share our vision of a more efficient and secure event management ecosystem. Together, we can drive this innovation forward and revolutionize the industry.

🚀 The Future of Event Organization

Our project demonstrates the immense potential of blockchain technology in the world of event organization. We are excited about the possibilities and the positive impact it can have on the industry.

Thank you to our dedicated team for their hard work and commitment to making this vision a reality. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to innovate and shape the future of event management.
